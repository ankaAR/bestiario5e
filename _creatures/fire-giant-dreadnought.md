***Dual Shields.*** The giant carries two shields, each of which is accounted for in the giant's AC. The giant must stow or drop one of its shields to hurl rocks.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The giant makes two fireshield attacks.

***Fireshield.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +13 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 22 (4d6+8) puntos de daño contundente plus 7 (2d6) fire damage plus 7 (2d6) puntos de daño perforante.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, range 60/240 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 30 (4d10+8) puntos de daño contundente.

***Shield Charge.*** The giant moves up to 30 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature smaller than Huge. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, it makes a fireshield attack against that creature. If the attack hits, the target must also succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed ahead of the giant for the rest of this move. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also knocked prone and takes 18 (3d6+8) puntos de daño contundente, or 29 (6d6+8) puntos de daño contundente if it was already prone.
