***Keen Smell.*** The carrion crawler has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Spider Climb.*** The carrion crawler can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The carrion crawler makes two attacks: one with its tentacles and one with its bite.

***Tentacles.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +8 al ataque, alcance 10 pies (3 mts), una criatura. Impacto: 4 (1d4 + 2) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poison on itself on a success.

***Bite.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +4 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage.
