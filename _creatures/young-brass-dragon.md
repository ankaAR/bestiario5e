### Actions

***Multiataque.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +7 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +7 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 11 (2d6 + 4) puntos de daño cortante.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

Fire Breath. The dragon exhales fire in a 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Sleep Breath. The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 5 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
