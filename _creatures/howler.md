***Pack Tactics.*** A howler has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the howler's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Acciones

***Multiattack*** The howler makes two bite attacks.

***Rending Bite*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +6 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 10 (2d6 + 3) puntos de daño perforante. If the target is asustado it takes an additional 22 (4d10) psychic damage. This attack ignores damage resistance.

***Mind-Breaking Howl (Recarga 6)*** The howler emits a keening howl in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area that isn't ensordecido must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be asustado until the end of the howler's next turn. While a creature is asustado in this way, its speed is halved, and it is incapacitated. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.
