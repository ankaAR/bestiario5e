***Dragon Fanatic.*** The dragonwing has advantage on saving throws against being hechizado or asustado. While the dragonwing can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, the dragonwing ignores the effects of being hechizado or asustado.

***Fanatic Advantage.*** Once per turn, if the dragonwing makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage.

***Limited Flight.*** The dragonwing can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

***Pack Tactics.*** The dragonwing has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dragonwing's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The dragonwing attacks twice with its scimitar.

***Cimitarra.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +5 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 6 (1d6 + 3) puntos de daño cortante más 3 (1d6) damage of the type to which the cultist has resistance.
