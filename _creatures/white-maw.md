***Ooze Nature.*** White Maw doesn't require sleep.

***Amorphous Form.*** White Maw can occupy another creature's space and vice versa.

***Corrode Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits White Maw corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits White Maw is destroyed after dealing damage.

>White Maw can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.

***False Appearance.*** While White Maw remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from white stone.

***Killer Response.*** Any creature that starts its turn in White Maw's space is targeted by a pseudopod attack if White Maw isn't incapacitated.

### Acciones

***Pseudopod.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +8 al ataque, alcance 10 pies (3 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 22 (4d8 + 4) puntos de daño contundente más 9 (2d8) puntos de daño por ácido. If the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.
