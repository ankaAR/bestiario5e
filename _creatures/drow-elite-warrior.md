***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: dancing lights

1/day each: darkness, faerie fire, levitate (self only)

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +7 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 7 (1d6 + 4) puntos de da침o perforante plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

***Hand Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 30/120 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 7 (1d6 + 4) puntos de da침o perforante, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
