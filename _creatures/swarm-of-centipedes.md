***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

### Acciones

***Bites.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +3 al ataque, alcance 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 (4d4) puntos de daño perforante, or 5 (2d4) puntos de daño perforante if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a swarm of centipedes is stable but envenenado for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and paralizado while envenenado in this way.
