***Echolocation.*** The swarm can't use its Vista ciega while deafened.

***Keen Hearing.*** The swarm has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny bat. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
