***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

***Multiataque.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +17 al ataque, alcance 15 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

***Claw.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +17 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 17 (2d6 + 10) puntos de daño cortante.

***Cola.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +17 al ataque, alcance 20 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 19 (2d8 + 10) puntos de daño contundente.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions

The ancient red dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The ancient red dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detectar.*** The dragon hace una prueba de Sabiduría (Percepción).

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (cuesta 2 acciones).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) puntos de daño contundente and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
