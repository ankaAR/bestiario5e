***Infernal Despair.*** Each creature within 15 feet of Hutijin that isn't a devil makes saving throws with disadvantage.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Hutijin's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
* At will: alter self (can become Medium when changing his appearance), animate dead, detect magic, hold monster, invisibility (self only), lightning bolt, suggestion, wall of fire
* 3/day: dispel magic
* 1/day each: heal, symbol (hopelessness only)

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Hutijin fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Hutijin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Hutijin's weapon attacks are magical.

***Regeneration.*** Hutijin regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Hutijin dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** Hutijin makes four attacks: one with his bite, one with his claw, one with his mace, and one with his tail.

***Bite*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +15 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 15 (2d6 + 8) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points, and it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claw*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +15 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage.

***Mace*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +15 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 15 (2d6 + 8) puntos de daño contundente.

***Tail*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +15 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 19 (2d10 + 8) puntos de daño contundente.

***Teleport*** Hutijin magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Legendary Actions

Hutijin can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Hutijin regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Attack*** Hutijin attacks once with his mace.

***Lightning Storm (cuesta 2 acciones)*** Hutijin releases lightning in a 20-foot radius. All other creatures in that area must each make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Teleport*** Hutijin uses his Teleport action.
