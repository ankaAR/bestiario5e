***Martial Advantage.*** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 14 (4d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 pies (1.5 mts)of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The hobgoblin makes three melee attacks. Alternatively, it can make two ranged attacks with its javelins.

***Longsword.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +9 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Shield Bash.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +9 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), una criatura. Impacto: 5 (1d4 + 3) puntos de daño contundente. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Jabalina.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts)or range 30/120 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 6 (1d6 + 3) puntos de daño perforante.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The hobgoblin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the hobgoblin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
