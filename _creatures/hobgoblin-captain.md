***Martial Advantage.*** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 10 (3d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft. of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiataque.*** The hobgoblin makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +4 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.

***Javelin.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 al ataque, alcance 5 ft. or range 30/120 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 ft. of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated.
