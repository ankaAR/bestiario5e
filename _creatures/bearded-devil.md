***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Steadfast.*** The devil can't be asustado while it can see an allied creature within 30 feet of it.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and one with its glaive.

***Beard.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +5 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), una criatura. Impacto: 6 (1d8 + 2) puntos de daño perforante, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be envenenado for 1 minute. While envenenado in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Glaive.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +5 al ataque, alcance 10 pies (3 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 8 (1d10 + 3) puntos de daño cortante. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
