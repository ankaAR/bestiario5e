### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Mordisco.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +2 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 3 (1d6) puntos de daño perforante.

***Claws.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +2 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 5 (2d4) puntos de daño cortante.

***Fetid Cloud (1/Día).*** A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
