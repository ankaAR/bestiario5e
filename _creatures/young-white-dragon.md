***Ice Walk.*** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.

### Actions

***Multiataque.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
