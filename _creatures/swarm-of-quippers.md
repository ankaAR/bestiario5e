***Blood Frenzy.*** The swarm has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny quipper. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Water Breathing.*** The swarm can breathe only underwater.
