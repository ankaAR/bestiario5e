***Searing Armor.*** The razerblast's armor is hot. Any creature grappling the razerblast or grappled by it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the end of that creature's turn.

***Shrapnel Explosion.*** When the razerblast drops to 0 hit points, a flaming orb in its chest explodes, destroying the razerblast's body and scattering its armor as shrapnel. Creatures within 10 feet of the razerblast when it explodes must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) puntos de daño perforante on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Acciones

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 al ataque, alcance 5 ft. or range 20/60 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 6 (1d6 + 3) puntos de daño perforante, or 7 (1d8 + 3) puntos de daño perforante if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
