***Innate Spellcasting.*** The glabrezu's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16). The glabrezu can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: darkness, detect magic, dispel magic

1/day each: confusion, fly, power word stun

***Magic Resistance.*** The glabrezu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The glabrezu makes four attacks: two with its pincers and two with its fists. Alternatively, it makes two attacks with its pincers and casts one spell.

***Pincer.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +9 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 16 (2d10 + 5) puntos de daño contundente. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). The glabrezu has two pincers, each of which can grapple only one target.

***Fist.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +9 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 7 (2d4 + 2) puntos de daño contundente.

***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Día).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A glabrezu has a 30 percent chance of summoning 1d3 vrocks, 1d2 hezrous, or one glabrezu.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
