***Death Burst.*** When the mephit dies, it leaves behind a cloud of smoke that fills a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on its space. The sphere is heavily obscured. Wind disperses the cloud, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute.

***Innate Spellcasting (1/Día).*** The mephit can innately cast dancing lights, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

### Acciones

***Claws.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +4 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), una criatura. Impacto: 4 (1d4 + 2) puntos de daño cortante.

***Cinder Breath (Recarga 6).*** The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of smoldering ash. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mephit's next turn .

***Variant: Summon Mephits (1/Día).*** The mephit has a 25 percent chance of summoning 1d4 mephits of its kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
