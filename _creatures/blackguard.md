***Spellcasting.*** The blackguard is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared:

1st level (4 slots): command, protection from evil and good, thunderous smite

2nd level (3 slots): branding smite, find steed

3rd level (2 slots): blinding smite, dispel magic

### Actions

***Multiataque.*** The blackguard makes three attacks with its glaive or its shortbow.

***Glaive.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 9 (1d10+4) slashing damage.

***Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 80/320 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage.

***Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The blackguard exudes magical menace. Each enemy within 30 feet of the blackguard must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If a frightened target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the blackguard, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
