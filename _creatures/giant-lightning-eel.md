***Mordisco.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +5 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 10 (2d6 + 3) puntos de daño perforante más 4 (1d8) lightning damage.

***Lightning jolt (Recarga 5-6).*** One creature the eel touches within 5 feet of it outside water, or each creature within l5 feet of it in a body of water, must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.

On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.
