***Anfibio.*** The chuul puede respirar aire y agua.

***Sense Magic.*** The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the detect magic spell but isn't itself magical.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.

***Pincer.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +6 al ataque, alcance 10 pies (3 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 11 (2d6 + 4) puntos de daño contundente. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn't have two other creatures grappled.

***Tentacles.*** One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be envenenado for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralizado. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
