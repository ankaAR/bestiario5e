* 1/day each: confusion, dominate person, mass suggestion

***Magic Resistance.*** The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The abishai's weapon attacks are magical. Actions

***Multiataque.*** The abishai makes two attacks, one with its claws and one with its longsword, or it casts one spell from its Innate Spellcasting trait and makes one claw attack.

***Longsword.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +6 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 5 (1d8 + 1) puntos de daño cortante, or 6 (1d10 + 1) puntos de daño cortante if used with two hands.

***Claws.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +8 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 12 (2d8 + 3) puntos de daño perforante.

The envenenado target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
