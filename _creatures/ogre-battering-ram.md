### Acciones

***Bash*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +6 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 15 (2d10 + 4) puntos de daño contundente, and the ogre can push the target 5 feet away if the target is Huge or smaller.

***Block the Path*** Until the start of the ogre's next turn, attack rolls against the ogre have disadvantage, it has advantage on the attack roll it makes for an opportunity attack, and that attack deals an extra 16 (3d10) puntos de daño contundente on a hit.
