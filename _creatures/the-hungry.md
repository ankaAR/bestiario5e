***Life Hunger.*** If a creature the Hungry can see regains hit points, the Hungry gains two benefits until the end of its next turn: it has advantage on attack rolls, and its bite deals an extra 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a hit.

### Acciones

***Multiattack*** The Hungry makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +8 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.

***Claws*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +8 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 18 (4d6 + 4) puntos de da√±o cortante. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 16) and is restrained until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, the Hungry can't attack with its claws.
