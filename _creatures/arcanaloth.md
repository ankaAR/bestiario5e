***Teleport.*** The arcanaloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Variant: Summon Yugoloth (1/Día).*** The yugoloth attempts a magical summoning.

An arcanaloth has a 40 percent chance of summoning one arcanaloth.

A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, does as it pleases, and can't summon other yugoloths. The summoned yugoloth remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action to dismiss it.
