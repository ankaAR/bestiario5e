***Fire Absorption.*** Whenever the giant strider is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to half the fire damage dealt.

### Acciones

***Mordisco.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +6 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 8 (1d8+4) puntos de da√±o perforante.

***Fire Burst (Recharges 5-6).*** The giant strider hurls a gout of flame at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners, and it ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried.
