***Anfibio.*** The dragon puede respirar aire y agua.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

***Multiataque.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +11 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

***Claw.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +11 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 13 (2d6 + 6) puntos de daño cortante.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours .

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
