***Anfibio.*** The dragon turtle puede respirar aire y agua.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 al ataque, alcance 15 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.

***Cola.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +13 al ataque, alcance 15 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked prone.

***Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
