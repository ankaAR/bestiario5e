***Cunning Action.*** On each of its turns, the thief can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

***Evasion.*** If the thief is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the thief instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The thief deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the thief that isn't incapacitated and the thief doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The thief makes three attacks with its shortsword.

***Shortsword.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +7 al ataque, alcance 5pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 7 (1d6+4) puntos de da침o perforante.

***Light Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 80/320 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 8 (1d8+4) puntos de da침o perforante.

### Reactions

***Uncanny Dodge.*** The thief halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The thief must be able to see the attacker.
