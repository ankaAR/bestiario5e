***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Naergoth has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** Naergoth makes three attacks, either with his longsword or longbow. He can use Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

***Life Drain.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +9 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 20 (5d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Longsword.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +9 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 + 5) if used with two hands, plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 150/600 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 5 (1d8 + 1) puntos de daño perforante plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
