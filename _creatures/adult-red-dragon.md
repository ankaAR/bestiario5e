***Resistencia Legendaria (3/Día).*** Si el dragón falla una tirada de salvación, puede decidir tener éxito en su lugar.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The dragon can use its Resistencia Pavorosa. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Mordisco.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +14 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 19 (2d10 + 8) puntos de daño perforante plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Garras.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +14 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 15 (2d6 + 8) puntos de daño cortante.

***Cola.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +14 al ataque, alcance 15 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 17 (2d8 + 8) puntos de daño contundente.

***Resistencia Pavorosa.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 ft. of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Resistencia Pavorosa for the next 24 hours.

***Fire Breath (Recarga 5-6).*** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Lair Actions.*** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

>* Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

>* A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot-radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

>* Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.

### Acciones Legendarias

The adult red dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The adult red dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detectar.*** The dragon hace una prueba de Sabiduría (Percepción).

***Ataque de Cola.*** El dragón hace un ataque con la cola.

***Ataque de Ala (cuesta 2 acciones).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) puntos de daño contundente and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
