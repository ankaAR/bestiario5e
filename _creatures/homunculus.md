***Telepathic Bond.*** While the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically.

### Acciones

***Mordisco.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +4 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), una criatura. Impacto: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instead poisoned for 5 (1d10) minutes and unconscious while poisoned in this way.
