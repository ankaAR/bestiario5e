***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

***Multiataque.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +11 to hit, reach,.0 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +11 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 13 (2d6 + 6) puntos de daño cortante.

***Cola.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +11 al ataque, alcance 15 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 15 (2d8 + 6) puntos de daño contundente.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

Fire Breath. The dragon exhales fire in an 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Sleep Breath. The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
