***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.

***Slam.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +7 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 13 (2d8 + 4) puntos de daño contundente.

***Engulf.*** The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is cegado, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) puntos de daño contundente. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
