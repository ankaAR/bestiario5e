***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +12 al ataque, alcance 10 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

***Claw.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +12 al ataque, alcance 5 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 14 (2d6 + 7) puntos de daño cortante.

***Cola.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +12 al ataque, alcance 15 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 16 (2d8 + 7) puntos de daño contundente.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 ft. of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 ft. wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (cuesta 2 acciones).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) puntos de daño contundente and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
