***Magic Resistance.*** The vrock has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Acciones

***Multiataque.*** The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

***Beak.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +6 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 10 (2d6 + 3) puntos de daño perforante.

***Talons.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +6 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 14 (2d10 + 3) puntos de daño cortante.

***Spores (Recarga 6).*** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become envenenado. While envenenado in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

***Stunning Screech (1/Día).*** The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the vrock's next turn .

***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Día).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A vrock has a 30 percent chance of summoning 2d4 dretches or one vrock.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
