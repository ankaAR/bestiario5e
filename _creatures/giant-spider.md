***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Acciones

***Mordisco.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +5 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), una criatura. Impacto: 7 (1d8 + 3) puntos de da√±o perforante, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

***Web (Recarga 5-6).*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/60 pies (XX mts), una criatura. Impacto: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
