### Acciones

***Longsword.*** Ataque de arma cuerpo a cuerpo: +2 al ataque, alcance 5 pies (1.5 mts), un objetivo. Impacto: 1 slashing damage.

***Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 40/160 pies, un objetivo. Impacto: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become envenenado for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the envenenado target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

***Heart Sight.*** The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.

***Invisibility.*** The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.
